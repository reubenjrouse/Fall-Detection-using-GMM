# Fall Detection using GMM

This project is a Streamlit-based application designed to detect falls in video footage by leveraging optical flow analysis and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The app processes each frame of a video to extract motion features and then uses clustering to identify potential fall events. To streamline the process, weâ€™ve included a pre-trained GMM model, allowing you to quickly evaluate the fall detection capabilities with your own videos without needing to train the model yourself.

This tool is highly applicable in settings where fall detection is critical, such as in healthcare for monitoring elderly patients, in smart home environments, or in workplace safety systems. It provides a practical solution for early fall detection, enabling timely responses and enhancing overall safety.

### GMM Clustering

Visualize the clustering of each frame to see how the model groups fall frames and non fall frames.
